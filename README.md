# MapleSyrupMath
As much as I usually toot my own horn for the jokes, I must clarify, this library sucks, intentionally or not is a question to be asked by me.

Poor formatting for now, no headers, all functions are implemented in main.c,
I plan on changing that sooner or later.

However, 100% of this code was written by me, at most I'd look at a mathematic model and make something out of it, or just have offsets.
None of this is C&P, and I sincerely hope nobody does so to me without credits.
As many math libraries as there are, I'm doing this for the understanding of the implementation whenever I write fsin(x).

I left this-
I did nothing for months :-)
good thing I have GIT, not one of my harddrives survived the fire

I found out today that math.h is a (relatively (coming from a person who has unfortunately dealt with Windows.h)) small header
I suppose I'll finish it soon

Goals:
Write it in C, as god says (only joking, I am fair with C++)
Have it be compatible with most inplementations, where you could swap "#include <math.h>" with "#include "math.h""
and notice very little difference (maybe not in performance or accuracy :p
